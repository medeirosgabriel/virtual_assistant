# Virtual Assistant
* ## Goal: Learn different python technologies.
* ## Language: Python.
* ## The virtual assistant uses various technologies to perform its functions.
* ## Among these functions we can mention: news, youtube downloader, music_player and searches. All separated into modules.
* ## All commands are by voice and the function to be executed is triggered through a router, which will interpret the command by voice.
* ## I'm still finishing the implementation. (Implementing the rasa framework for entity extraction)
